# Debugging


While you run and play around with the project you should be able to see every activity on the console.

But here are two common errors that you might see and what they mean.

## Agent error

:::danger Error

Error occurred while running the AI agent. Please try again !!

:::

This error occurs rarely when OpenAI client throws, and this usually means something went wrong with OpenAI access.


## Google Calendar API errors

:::danger Error

Error occurred while running the tool. Please try again !!

:::

If you see this error then something most likely went wrong while running google-calendar API.

- If there is a refresh-token error, which should mean your refresh token is expired and you need to `delete` google-calendar app and `install` again.
- If there is another error, then its most likely an API error, check the console to debug it.
